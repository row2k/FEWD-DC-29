##CSS Experimentation

We've gone over some good properties to use but they are hard to grasp without actually using them. Included in this assignment is a (mostly) REAL chunk of a website I've built.

###Style time

Your goal is to make each section of this page look like this example:

![Design Goal](img/target-look.png)

1) Download the zip file in this directory to somewhere on your computer that you put web files. Unzip it.

2) Your first task is to use the font, background and text classes to improve the look of this page.

3) Your second task is to link the images to page using relative links. Also, try and find the buried page and link it to main index page (use a relative link).

4) Your third task is to consider the box model and use padding and margin around each section of content to make it look like the example above.
